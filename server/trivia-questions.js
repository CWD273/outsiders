He, who had taken a life, risked his own to save others, showing courage and selflessness that contrasted with his earlier fear and defensiveness." },
    { text: "Which character undergoes the most growth, and how?", answer: "Ponyboy likely undergoes the most growth. He starts as more naive and sheltered but learns about social injustice, empathy, and the complexities of human nature through his experiences and relationships." },
    { text: "How might the story be different if it were told from Cherry’s perspective?", answer: "If told from Cherry's perspective, the story would offer a view into the Socs' world, their own pressures and insecurities, and her unique position as someone who sees beyond the gang rivalry.

    { text: "Discuss the role of violence in the story—does it solve problems or create them?", answer: "Violence in the story primarily creates more problems.

    { text: "What would you say is the main message or moral of The Outsiders?", answer: "A main message of The Outsiders is the importance of empathy, understanding, and looking beyond superficial differences to recognize the shared humanity among people, regardless of social class or background." },
    { text: "How do the final scenes of the novel tie back to the beginning?", answer: "The final scenes, where Ponyboy begins writing his English theme about the Greasers, tie back to the beginning of the novel, which is presented as that very theme.
